# Hello.
My name is Danya. I rarely use github because most of my projects are not opensource worthy. Some of them are too simple.

I code games, websites, tbh anything I want and I need, even a GMOD addon I've made for a joke.

# I know:
- Lua (gmod & roblox)
- Python
- CSS/HTML/JS
- GDscript
- C# (unity)
- SQL

# I use:
- GIMP
- Inkscape
- Godot
- Blender
- FL Studio 20
- OpenMPT

That's everything you need to know. See you next time.
